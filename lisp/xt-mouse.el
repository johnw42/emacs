;;; Commentary:

;; Enable mouse support when running inside an xterm.

;; This is actually useful when you are running X11 locally, but is
;; working on remote machine over a modem line or through a gateway.

;; It works by translating xterm escape codes into generic emacs mouse
;; events so it should work with any package that uses the mouse.

;; You don't have to turn off xterm mode to use the normal xterm mouse
;; functionality, it is still available by holding down the SHIFT key
;; when you press the mouse button.

;;; Todo:

;; Support multi-click -- somehow.

;;; Code:

(defvar xterm-mouse-debug-buffer nil)

;; Mouse events symbols must have an 'event-kind property with
;; the value 'mouse-click.
